In correct_altitude.py, we had some problems with altitude. it has errors and not accuracte, so we get longitude and latitude and use an API to get altitude.
in compute slope we used corrected_altitude and Cumulative_mileage to achieve slope.
in change_time_interval we changed 1s interval to 0.8s using a simple algorithm.
in divide we get an excel file and divide it to equal 610 rows csv file.
Trip specification get online csv files and summarize them in an excel file.

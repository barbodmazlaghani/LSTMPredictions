In correct_altitude.py, we had some problems with altitude. it has errors and not accuracte, so we get longitude and latitude and use an API to get altitude.
in compute slope we used corrected_altitude and Cumulative_mileage to achieve slope.
in change_time_interval we changed 1s interval to 0.8s using a simple algorithm.
in divide we get an excel file and divide it to equal 610 rows csv file.

Due to long file names, we should zip result images and csv files.

Our goal is find the best hyper parameter such as loss function, weight decay, grid search in hyperparameter for L1(MAE) L2(MSE) and smoothL1 for loss function, and 1e-4, 1e-5, 5e-5 and 1e-6.
Result and test show the best loss function is L1(MAE) and best value for WD is 1e-5.

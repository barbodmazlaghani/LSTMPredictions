New data is collected using Dena 791 - same as main dataset
Driver : Majid Naeemai
Main Goal : We tried adding new data to main dataset and didn't get expected result, we now want to see how prediction errors change, if we only use new data(100 to 120 km/h). 
Result : Accuracy reduced and Spike Remained but overall prediction improved due to inaccuracy in first sections

Due to long filenames, we should zip results.

We use LR scheduler for prevented under fitting or overfitting, we using grid search to find best value for start and stop LR-scheduler with different weight decay, we start LR from 1e-4 to 1e-6 and in the second approach start from 1e-5 to 1e-6 with three weight decay : 1e-4 , 1e-5 and 5e-5, We found the best parameters is start LR from 1e-4 to 1e-6 with 1e-5 weight decay.

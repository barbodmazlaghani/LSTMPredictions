In this folder we added coolant temp as feature for train the model. At first we just add and normalize between 0 and 130 but result shows the model not good. after that we mapped temp like upper than 75 mapped to 0(hot) and under the 75(cold) mapped to 1, again results not good, we saw that our training data hadn't have the cold temp for this reason we must create new data for training sets.

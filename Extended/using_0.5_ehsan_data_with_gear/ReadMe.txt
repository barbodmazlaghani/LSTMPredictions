The goal was find the frequency effect in the model training. The log time of this data was 0.5second (older data was 1 second) and we train with older hyperparameter and tested with sequence 200 and 600 and changed the weight decay from 1e-5 to 4e-6, but this parameter not good for high frequency and I think we should increase the sequence length to 1000 or 1200 to reach good results.

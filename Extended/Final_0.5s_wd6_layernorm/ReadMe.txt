this is our final model, data frequency is 2 Hz, Weight decay is e^-6, learning start from 10^-4 and decreasing by validation loss, blstm with layer normalization seq length equal to 600, features are speed, acceleration, gear and slope, gear N is mapped to 0.2 and gear R is mapped to 1. Data sources are equal to '/content/gdrive/MyDrive/data_aug(3_slices_with_repeated)_cluster_5_ehsan_0.5.zip' and '/content/gdrive/MyDrive/data_aug(3_slices_with_repeated)_cluster_5_ehsan_0.5_v2.rar'.
